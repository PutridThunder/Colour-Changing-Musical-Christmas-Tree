# Colour-Changing-Musical-Christmas-Tree
the terminal plays an animation of a christmas tree changing colours at random with lyrics to Last Christmas, while playing the song Last Christmas

saw a reel on Instagram of someone making a Christmas tree on Visual Studio, thought it looked so cool, so I decided to recreate their work. I did need to search up a few things, such as how i could play music on python, how can I customise the colours of each character, and how to make everything show up how I wanted it to. This was a fun 2 and a half hour learning experience
